# Traffic-Light-Control-using-Reinforcement-Learning
Traffic Light Control using Actor-Critic algorithm in Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) simulator

Run sumotest.py to train the actor-critic algorithm.

To run the simulation, open intersection.sumocfg in SUMO. Here is a snapshot of the intersection.
